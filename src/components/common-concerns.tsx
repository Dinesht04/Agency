    "problem": "Your team might be strong in one area but lack the comprehensive skills to take a digital product from concept to a fully deployed reality.",
    "solution": "We act as your dedicated product team, providing a unified skillset that covers everything from UI/UX design to front-end and back-end development. You get the expertise you need without having to hire for multiple roles."

    "id": 2,
    "title": "2. Prohibitive Costs & Hiring Delays",
    "problem": "Hiring a full-time senior designer and a developer is a significant financial commitment involving high salaries, benefits, and a lengthy recruitment process.",
    "solution": "Our flexible model gives you access to a complete design and development duo at a fraction of the cost. Get started immediately and scale with a predictable, cost-effective subscription."

    "id": 3,
    "title": "3. Overwhelmed Teams & Stalled Progress",
    "problem": "Internal teams are often stretched thin, causing feature backlogs to grow and key projects to be delayed.",
    "solution": "As a nimble two-person team, we provide the focused firepower to clear your backlog, build out a new feature, or launch your MVP. You get our undivided attention to ensure your project moves forward, fast."

    "id": 4,
    "title": "4. The Design-to-Development Gap",
    "problem": "Great designs often get lost in translation during the handoff to development, resulting in a final product that doesn't match the original vision.",
    "solution": "With us, there is no handoff. The designer and developer work in lockstep from day one. This guarantees a pixel-perfect implementation and a cohesive user experience, ensuring what you see in the design is exactly what gets built."
  },
  {
    "id": 5,
    "title": "5. Lack of a Unified Vision",
    "problem": "When design and development are separate, it's easy to lose sight of the core user problem, leading to a disconnected and ineffective final product.",
    "solution": "We operate as a single, cohesive unit obsessed with your success. This personal, unified approach ensures every design decision and line of code is purposefully aligned with your business goals and user needs."

    "id": 6,
    "title": "6. Communication Silos & Overhead",
    "problem": "Coordinating between project managers, external agencies, and internal teams creates communication overhead, delays, and costly misunderstandings.",
    "solution": "You get a single point of contact and direct access to the two people actually building your project. This radically simplifies communicationâ€”no layers of bureaucracy, just a direct, personal partnership focused on efficiency."
